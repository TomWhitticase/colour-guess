# Colour Guess 🎨

Welcome to Colour Guess! 🎉 This is a web-based game where you try to guess the hex code of the background colour. It was built using Next.js and styled with Tailwind CSS. This was my first project using Next.js, so it is very basic in nature.

To play the game, simply go to the website at https://colour-guess-tomwhitticase.vercel.app/ and enter your guess in the input field. You will be told how close you were to the correct answer.

If you have any questions or feedback about, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'd love to hear from you! 💬

Thank you for checking out my first project using Next.js. I hope you enjoy playing Colour Guess! 🙏
